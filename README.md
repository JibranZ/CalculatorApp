# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as clear the display and evaluate expressions.

## Features

- Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the calculator.
- Evaluate button (`=`) to compute the result of the arithmetic expression.
- Keyboard support for inputting numbers and operators.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

## How to Use

1. **Calculator Interface**:
   - The calculator interface displays a numeric keypad for entering numbers and operators.
   - It includes buttons for arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), decimal point (`.`), equals (`=`) for evaluation, and clear (`CL`) to reset the display.

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Click on the numeric buttons (`0-9`) to input numbers into the calculator display.
   - Click on the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic operations.
   - Use the decimal point (`.`) for decimal numbers.

3. **Clear and Evaluate**:
   - Click on the `CL` button to clear the display.
   - Click on the `=` button to evaluate the arithmetic expression entered and display the result.

4. **Keyboard Input**:
   - You can also use your keyboard for input:
     - Numbers (`0-9`), decimal point (`.`).
     - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
     - Enter key (`Enter`) to evaluate the expression.
     - Backspace key (`Backspace`) to delete the last character in the display.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If an invalid expression is entered or an error occurs during evaluation, the display will show "Error".

## Example Usage

1. **Simple Addition**:
   - Enter `5 + 3` and press `=` to get the result `8`.

2. **Multiplication**:
   - Enter `6 * 4` and press `=` to get the result `24`.

3. **Decimal Calculation**:
   - Enter `10.5 / 2` and press `=` to get the result `5.25`.

4. **Clear and Restart**:
   - Use `C` to clear the display and start a new calculation.
